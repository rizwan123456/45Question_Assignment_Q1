/* Problem Defenation:
              Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function 
              called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to 
              each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
           */
